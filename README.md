# chell

An interactive shell with a POSIX like syntax, `chell` will monitor commands
executed and move them into a new terminal split if they take too long to allow
continued execution of commands. Additionally `chell` provides error reports
for failed commands and suggestions on alternate commands or switches in
various circumstances.
